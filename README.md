# Sulphur CLI

Sulphur CLI is a CLI implementation of the [Sulphur Core Library](https://github.com/demperor-music/sulphur-core) I wrote.

## Installation

You can simply download the binary from the latest release.
However if you'd prefer an actual installation, you can use [the nix package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) to install this program by simply running:
```zsh
nix profile install github:demperor-music/sulphur_cli
```
Which should work on any linux distribution and on MacOS.
